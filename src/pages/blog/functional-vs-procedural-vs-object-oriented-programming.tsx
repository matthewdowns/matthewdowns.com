      <h1 id="overview">Functional vs. Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Programming languages can be categorized into several paradigms, including functional,
        procedural, and object-oriented programming. Each paradigm has its own set of principles
        and approaches to solving problems, and understanding these differences is essential for
        choosing the right approach for your project. In this blog post, we&apos;ll explore the main
        differences between these three programming paradigms.
      </p>

      <h3 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h3>
      <p>
        In functional programming, the focus is on writing code that is based on mathematical
        functions. The emphasis is on immutability, meaning that once a value is set, it cannot
        be changed. This means that all data structures are immutable and all operations on them
        create new data structures. Another core concept in functional programming is higher-order
        functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as
        output.
      </p>

      <h3 id="procedural-programming">Procedural Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Procedural programming focuses on the step-by-step instructions needed to solve a problem.
        The emphasis is on procedures, which are sequences of instructions that execute one after the
        other. Procedural programming is often used for solving problems that can be easily broken down
        into smaller, more manageable pieces. It&apos;s often used in scientific computing, simulation, and
        automation tasks.
      </p>

      <h3 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
      <p>
        In object-oriented programming, the emphasis is on creating objects that represent real-world
        entities. Objects are instances of classes, which define their behavior and properties. Classes
        are the blueprints for creating objects, and they can inherit properties and behavior from other
        classes. Object-oriented programming is often used for building complex applications that need to
        be modular and extensible.
      </p>

      <h4 id="key-differences">What are the main differences between these paradigms?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Functional programming emphasizes immutability, higher-order functions, and the use of mathematical
          functions to solve problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Procedural programming emphasizes step-by-step instructions and procedures to solve problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object-oriented programming emphasizes the creation of objects that represent real-world entities and
          can be modular and extensible.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Each programming paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right approach for your
          project depends on factors like the complexity of the problem, the size of the project, and the team&apos;s
          expertise. By understanding the differences between these paradigms, you can make an informed decision and
          choose the right approach for your project.

      <h3 id="functional-program">Functional Program</h3>
      <p>
        A program that needs to perform complex mathematical calculations would be better suited to be written in a functional
        programming language. This is because functional programming languages are often designed to handle complex mathematical
        operations and can take advantage of the mathematical concept of functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, let&apos;s say we want to write a program that computes the factorial of a given number. Using <strong>OCaml</strong>, we could
        write the following code:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose bg-slate-200 rounded-lg shadow">
        <Prism language="ocaml" withLineNumbers={true}>
          {`
let rec factorial n =
  if n <= 1 then 1
  else n * factorial (n-1)

let () =
  let n = 5 in
  let result = factorial n in
  Printf.printf "Factorial of %d is %d\\n" n result
`}
        </Prism>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this program, the factorial function is defined recursively, where the base case is when <em>n</em> is less than or equal to 1,
        and the recursive case computes n times the factorial of <em>n-1</em>. The <code>let () = ...</code> syntax defines an anonymous
        function that is immediately executed when the program starts. In this case, it simply computes the factorial of <em>5</em> and
        prints the result using the <code>Printf.printf</code> function.
      </p>
      <p className="bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 rounded-lg px-4 py-2">
        <small>
          Note that in OCaml, functions are first-class citizens, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions,
          returned as values from functions, and stored in data structures. This makes it easy to write higher-order functions, which
          are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. For example, you could write a higher-order
          function that takes a list of numbers and a function, and applies the function to each element of the list.
        </small>
      </p>

      <h3 id="procedural-program">Procedural Program</h3>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s an example of the same program written in a procedural programming language like <strong>C</strong>:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose bg-slate-200 rounded-lg shadow">
        <Prism language="c">
          {`
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
  int result = 1;
  for (int i = n; i > 1; i--) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}

int main() {
  int n = 5;
  int result = factorial(n);
  printf("Factorial of %d is %d\\n", n, result);
  return 0;
}
`}
        </Prism>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this program, the <code>factorial</code> function uses a loop to compute the factorial of the input number <em>n</em>. The loop initializes a variable
        result to <em>1</em>, and then multiplies it by each number from <em>n</em> down to <em>2</em>. Finally, the function returns the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main function simply calls the <code>factorial</code> function with an input of <em>5</em> and stores the result in a variable result. It then prints
        out the result using the <code>printf</code> function, and returns <em>0</em> to indicate successful completion.
      </p>
      <p className="bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 rounded-lg px-4 py-2">
        <small>
          Note that in procedural programming, the focus is on using procedures or functions to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. The
          emphasis is on procedures and the order in which they are executed, rather than on objects or mathematical functions as in functional programming. In the
          case of this factorial program, we use a loop to implement the iterative process of computing the factorial, rather than a recursive function as in the
          OCaml example.
        </small>
      </p>

      <h3 id="object-oriented-program">Object-Oriented Program</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, let&apos;s recreate the program once again - this time in <strong>C++</strong>, an object-oriented language.
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose bg-slate-200 rounded-lg shadow">
        <Prism language="cpp">
          {`
#include <iostream>

class FactorialCalculator {
public:
    static int Calculate(int n) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = n; i > 1; i--) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    int result = FactorialCalculator::Calculate(n);
    std::cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
`}
        </Prism>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this program, we define a <code>FactorialCalculator</code> class with a single static method <code>Calculate</code>, which takes an integer <em>n</em> as
        input and returns the factorial of <em>n</em>. The <code>Calculate</code> method uses a loop to compute the factorial in a similar way to the procedural version.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <code>main</code> function, we create an instance of the <code>FactorialCalculator</code> class and call its <code>Calculate</code> method with an input
        of <em>5</em>. We then store the result in a variable result and print it out using the <code>cout</code> stream.
      </p>
      <p className="bg-slate-300 dark:bg-slate-700 rounded-lg px-4 py-2">
        <small>
          Note that in object-oriented programming, the focus is on objects and their interactions, rather than on procedures or mathematical functions. Objects encapsulate
          data and behavior, and can interact with each other by sending messages or calling methods. In this example, we use a static method to encapsulate the behavior of
          computing the factorial, which can be called without creating an instance of the class.
